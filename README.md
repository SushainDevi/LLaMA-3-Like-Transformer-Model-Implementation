# LLaMA 3 Transformer Model Project

## **Project Aim**

The goal of this project is to implement a simplified version of the **LLaMA 3** (Large Language Model Meta AI) architecture using **PyTorch**, with a focus on understanding the key components of modern transformer-based language models. The project walks through the fundamental building blocks of the model, including tokenization, attention mechanisms, normalization layers, feedforward networks, and positional encodings, while enabling the generation of coherent text from user prompts.

Through this project, we aim to explore how the LLaMA 3 architecture works and to create a functional version of it that can be trained on small-scale datasets like the **Tiny Shakespeare** dataset. The ultimate goal is to generate meaningful text sequences based on input prompts by training a transformer architecture from scratch.

## **Project Overview**

This project implements the following components of the LLaMA 3 architecture:

1. **Input Block**:
   - The input block uses character-level tokenization based on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, converting text into numerical tokens. These tokens serve as input to the model for training and inference.
   
2. **RMSNorm and RoPE (Rotary Positional Encoding)**:
   - RMSNorm is used for normalization, ensuring stable training by rescaling activations.
   - RoPE provides the model with positional information, which helps the transformer understand the order of tokens in a sequence.
   
3. **Attention Mechanism**:
   - Implements multi-head self-attention to allow the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. This is critical for capturing contextual information.
   
4. **Feedforward Network**:
   - A two-layer feedforward network is applied after the attention mechanism to transform the data and improve model expressiveness.
   
5. **Transformer Block**:
   - Each transformer block consists of an attention mechanism, a feedforward network, and normalization layers. Multiple blocks are stacked to create a deep neural network.
   
6. **Training Loop**:
   - The model is trained on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, with cross-entropy loss used to guide learning. The loss gradually decreases as the model learns to generate text sequences based on the data.

7. **Text Generation**:
   - Once trained, the model can generate new sequences of text by taking an input prompt, predicting the next token, and iterating to create a longer text sequence. The model uses techniques like temperature and top-p sampling to generate diverse and coherent text.

## **Project Motivation and Purpose**

### **Understanding Transformer Architectures**
Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by enabling models to understand the contextual relationships between tokens in long sequences. **LLaMA 3**, developed by Meta, is an advanced version of these transformer-based architectures that can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, and summarization. By building a simplified version from scratch, this project helps in understanding the inner workings of a powerful language model, how it processes input data, and how it generates predictions.

### **Tokenization and Encoding**
The character-level tokenization used in this project is essential for feeding text into the transformer. Understanding how raw text is transformed into numerical representations is the first step in training and deploying any language model. This project showcases the importance of handling vocabulary and tokenization efficiently.

### **Self-Attention and Positional Encoding**
The attention mechanism is at the heart of the transformer architecture, allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. Without positional encoding, transformers would lack any notion of the order of tokens, which is crucial for language understanding. In this project, **Rotary Positional Encoding** (RoPE) is implemented, providing a sophisticated way for the model to learn positional relationships.

### **Model Training and Optimization**
Training a transformer model requires careful balancing of hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, hidden dimensions, and learning rates. The project’s training loop shows how the model is optimized over time, with the loss function providing feedback that guides the learning process. Training results demonstrate the gradual improvement of the model as it becomes better at predicting text.

### **Practical Application: Text Generation**
The final product of this project is a model capable of generating coherent text based on an input prompt. Through this project, we demonstrate the practicality of transformer-based models and how they can be applied to real-world tasks, such as story generation, text completion, or conversational agents.
